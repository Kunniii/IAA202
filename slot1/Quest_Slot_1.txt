__**What risk is and what its relationship to threat, vulnerability, and loss is?**__

+ risk is the likehood that loos will occur

+ vulnerabilities are weak spots within the environment and the assets—weaknesses that open up to potential threats and increased risk
**  => Vulnerable increase Risk

+ threat refers to any possible malicious attack that seeks to unlawfully access data, disrupt digital operations or damage information
+ threat is a vulnerability in the environment that they can exploit
**  => Threats are vulnerabilities that are exploitable

+ loss is unable to keep or maintain Asset
**  => loss will occur when a threat expose a vulnuerability exploit

User domain - any user of our systems falls in this domain, whether inside or outside our organization
Workstation domain - not just computers, but any device our users use
LAN domain - each LAN and the devices that make a LAN work
WAN domain - the system that links devices across long distances; typically this is the Internet which is used by most businesses
LAN-to-WAN domain - the infrastructure and devices that connect our organization's LANs to the WAN system
Remote Access domain - the technologies used by our mobile and remote users to connect to their customary resources; can include VPN solutions and encryption technology
System/Application domain - technologies used to actually conduct business functions, as opposed to making connections of various types


__**What risk management is and how it is important to the organization?**__

**What is Risk Management**
Risk Management is the practice of identifying, assessing, controlling, and mitigating risks.
Threats and vulnerabilities are key drivers of risk.
Identifying the threats and vulnerabilities - an important step.
Risk Management attempts to identify the risks
that can be minimized and implement controls to do so.
Risk Management starts with a Risk Assessment (or Risk Analysis).

**Its important to organization**
Risk affects an organization’s survivability
Reasonableness
Balancing Risk and Cost
Role-Based Perceptions of Risk







1. What risk is and what its relationship to threat, vulnerability, and loss is?
 - Risk means the possibility of loss or injury. (Dictionary)
 - Threat is a process that magnifies the likelihood of a negative event
    is any circumstance or event with the potential to cause a loss
    => risk is the potential for loss, damage or destruction of assets or data caused by a cyber threat
 - Vulnerability is a weakness in infrastructure, networks or applications 
    => that potentially exposes you to threats.
    => increase risks
 - Loss is the act or fact of being unable to keep or maintain something (Dictionary)

 it means we can't keep or maintain the information, property, people or anything else that we care about (Asset)
    => an important risk

2. (From slide) What the major components of risk to an IT infrastructure are?
User domain - any user of our systems falls in this domain, whether inside or outside our organization
Workstation domain - not just computers, but any device our users use
LAN domain - each LAN and the devices that make a LAN work
WAN domain - the system that links devices across long distances; typically this is the Internet which is used by most businesses
LAN-to-WAN domain - the infrastructure and devices that connect our organization's LANs to the WAN system
Remote Access domain - the technologies used by our mobile and remote users to connect to their customary resources; can include VPN solutions and encryption technology
System/Application domain - technologies used to actually conduct business functions, as opposed to making connections of various types

3. What risk management is and how it is important to the organization?
 - Risk management is the continuing process to identify, analyze, evaluate, and treat loss exposures 
    and monitor risk control and financial resources to mitigate the adverse effects of loss.
*
 - to define risk as anything that can prevent the company from achieving its objectives.
 - Although accidental losses are unforeseen and unplanned, there are methods that can make events more predictable.
 - since the occurrence can be prevented or mitigated; or, at minimum, expenses can be estimated and budgeted.
